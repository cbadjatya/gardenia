GARDENIA: Graph Analytics Repository for Designing Efficient Next-generation Accelerators

Link: https://github.com/chenxuhao/gardenia

This is the reference implementation for the [GARDENIA](https://chenxuhao.github.io/) [Benchmark Suite](https://chenxuhao.github.io/). It is designed to be a portable high-performance baseline for desgining next-generation accelerators. It uses CUDA, OpenCL and OpenMP for parallelism. The details of the benchmark can be found in the [specification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04567.pdf).

The GARDENIA Benchmark Suite is an extented version of the [GAP](https://gap.cs.berkeley.edu/) [Benchmark Suite](https://gap.cs.berkeley.edu/benchmark.html) which is intended to help graph processing research by standardizing evaluations. The benchmark provides a baseline implementation which incorporates state-of-the-art optimization techniques proposed for modern accelerators, such as GPUs and MICs. These baseline implementations are representative of state-of-the-art performance, and thus new contributions should outperform them to demonstrate an improvement. The code infrastructure is ported from GAPBS and Lonstargpu by the [ISS group](http://iss.ices.utexas.edu/?p=projects/galois/lonestargpu) at the University of Texas. 
To run the benchmarks on the GPGPU-Sim simulator, please use the [revised GPGPU-Sim version](https://github.com/chenxuhao/gpgpu-sim-ndp) and we highly recommend you to use CUDA-5.5 for the compatibility issue.
Note that in the code, 'm' is the number of vertices, and 'nnz' is the number of edges.
Graphs are stored as the CSR format in memory.
CSR is represented by two auxiliary data structures: 'row_offsets' and 'column_indices'.
You will need to download [CUB](https://nvlabs.github.io/cub/).

Quick Start
-----------

Setup CUB library:

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive

Setup environment variables:

    $ cd src
    $ cp common.mk.example common.mk
    $ vim common.mk // modify this file to setup the compilation

Build the project (you will need to install gcc and nvcc first):

    $ make

Or go to each sub-directory, e.g. src/bfs, and then

    $ make

Download datasets from the UFSMC or SNAP website:

    $ wget https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/MM/SNAP/soc-LiveJournal1.tar.gz

Decompress the dataset file and put it in the 'datasets' sub-directory:

    $ tar zxvf soc-LiveJournal1.tar.gz
    $ mv soc-LiveJournal1.mtx datasets/

Find out commandline format by running executable without argument:

    $ cd bin
    $ ./bfs_linear_base
    Usage: ./bfs_linear_base <filetype> <graph-prefix> [symmetrize(0/1)] [reverse(0/1)] [source_id(0)]

Run BFS on a directed graph starting from vertex 0:

    $ cd bin
    $ ./bfs_linear_base mtx ../datasets/soc-LiveJournal1 0 0 0

To run on CPU or Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor, set the following environment variable:

    $ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=[ number of cores in system ]


Graph Loading
-------------

The graph loading infrastructure understands the following formats:

+ `.mtx` [Matrix Market](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html) format

+ `.gr` [9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge](https//www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml) format

+ `.graph` Metis format (used in [10th DIMACS Implementation Challenge](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/dimacs10/index.shtml))
